
== IPG Database Script to update latest snapshot ===

Avinash,

I will include the directions in the document when I send it out updated, but here they are for you to get started.
Here is the version of mysql I am running:
Server version: 5.7.10 MySQL Community Server (GPL)

And here is the process I use to open and use the database snapshot that Ashish sends me


Open Terminal (on your mac)
Log into your mysql:
     mysql -u root -p
Create a new database for the snapshot, I always name it after the date so I can make sure I'm using the correct one:
    CREATE DATABASE Aug29;
Log out of mysql
    \q
Load the database dump file into your new database:
    mysql -u root -p Aug29 < Documents/ipg_db_dumps/name_of_dump_file.sql
this step takes quite a while to process, so leave that running until it's finished, then check that the database populated properly
    mysql -u root -p
    use Aug29;
    SELECT * FROM webform_submissions LIMIT 10;
If the above query returns responses then it worked, if it returns an error, it did not.
If the database is properly working, I delete any old instances I have to ensure I'm working with the most recent data
